HumanCompatible.Explain Documentation
=====================================================

This documentation contains the explainability methods developed for the **AutoFair** project. These tools are designed to provide insight into machine learning models through counterfactual explanations, with a focus on fairness and transparency.

Included Methods
----------------

- **GLANCE**: A versatile and adaptive framework for generating global counterfactual explanations. These explanations are expressed as actions that offer recourse to large population subgroups. The framework aims to provide explanations and insights, ensuring that the actions benefit as many individuals as possible.
- **FACTS**: An efficient, model-agnostic, highly parameterizable, and explainable framework for evaluating subgroup fairness through counterfactual explanations. FACTS facilitates in-depth analysis of fairness across different subgroups by simulating alternative decision outcomes.

Explore the documentation below for details on the implementation, usage, and customization of these methods.
