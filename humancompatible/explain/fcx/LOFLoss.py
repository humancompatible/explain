    Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as a differentiable loss for anomaly detection.

    This loss computes the average LOF score over a batch of input vectors,

        n_neighbors (int): Number of nearest neighbors to consider (excluding self) when
            computing reachability distances. Default is 20.
